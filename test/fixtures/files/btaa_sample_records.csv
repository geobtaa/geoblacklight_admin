Climate-biome envelope model for the Western Great Lakes Region,Climate-biome envelope model for the Western Great Lakes Region,"Research Highlights: We modeled climate-biome envelopes at high resolution in the Western Great Lakes Region for recent and future time-periods. The projected biome shifts, in conjunction with heterogeneous distribution of protected land, may create both great challenges for conservation of particular ecosystems and novel conservation opportunities. Background and Objectives: Climate change this century will affect the distribution and relative abundance of ecological communities against a mostly static background of protected land. We developed a climate-biome envelope model using a priori climate-vegetation relationships for the Western Great Lakes Region (Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan USA and adjacent Ontario, Canada) to predict potential biomes and ecotones—boreal forest, mixed forest, temperate forest, prairie–forest border, and prairie—for a recent climate normal period (1979–2013) and future conditions (2061–2080). Materials and Methods: We analyzed six scenarios, two representative concentration pathways (RCP)—4.5 and 8.5, and three global climate models to represent cool, average, and warm scenarios to predict climate-biome envelopes for 2061–2080. To assess implications of the changes for conservation, we analyzed the amount of land with climate suited for each of the biomes and ecotones both region-wide and within protected areas, under current and future conditions. Results: Recent biome boundaries were accurately represented by the climate-biome envelope model. The modeled future conditions show at least a 96% loss in areas suitable for the boreal and mixed forest from the region, but likely gains in areas suitable for temperate forest, prairie–forest border, and prairie. The analysis also showed that protected areas in the region will most likely lose most or all of the area, 18,692 km2, currently climatically suitable for boreal forest. This would represent an enormous conservation loss. However, conversely, the area climatically suitable for prairie and prairie–forest border within protected areas would increase up to 12.5 times the currently suitable 1775 km2. Conclusions: These results suggest that retaining boreal forest in potential refugia where it currently exists and facilitating transition of some forests to prairie, oak savanna, and temperate forest should both be conservation priorities in the northern part of the region.|Data included here are the R code used to process the publicly available CHELSA data (see publications for citation) into the biome-climate envelope product (as .R files and .txt files) and the climate-biome envelope product itself (as .tif files).",eng,"Butler, Ethan E.|Frelich, Lee E.|Reich, Peter B.|Toot, Ryan",null|null|null|null,"",University of Minnesota,Datasets,Vector data|Raster data,"",Climate,|2022-creator-sprint,1979–2013|2061–2080,2021-02-16,1979-2013,Minnesota|Wisconsin|Michigan| Canada--Ontario|Canada|Lake Superior|Lake Huron|Lake Michigan,"-96.08,41.28,-81.03,50.35","POLYGON((-96.08 50.35, -81.03 50.35, -81.03 41.28, -96.08 41.28, -96.08 50.35))","","",dc8c18df-7d64-4ff4-a754-d18d0891187d,05d-03,"","","","",Shapefile,,,false,,,,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.13020/s99e-s560,,,,,,,,,,,https://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/handle/11299/218536/normals_thumbnail.png,13020-s99e-s560,https://doi.org/10.13020/s99e-s560,05d-03,https://conservancy.umn.edu/pages/drum/policies/#terms-of-use,"",https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/,Public,Manual,,2022-06-23,,Active,published,false,false,"",,2022-06-23 21:31:20 UTC,2023-02-03 21:43:46 UTC
Michigan Great Lakes Grids [Michigan],Michigan Great Lakes Grids,"In the Great Lakes, grid systems defined by latitude and longitude minutes have been used for a number of decades as a fishery standard for data reporting. The Michigan Department of Natural Resources (MDNR) Fisheries Division created this GIS layer in 2019 to depict the MDNR Michigan Great Lakes grid (v3.2) standard for Fisheries Division applications for the waters of the State of Michigan, and for Canadian waters in the St. Clair Detroit River System (SCDRS), as of June 2019. This GIS layer was created by incorporating grid boundaries and ID values from a number of existing grid standards.This layer is a composite grid that incorporates grid boundaries and ID values from the following GIS data standards for different areas of the Great Lakes: 1) 10-minute grids for Lakes Huron, Michigan, Superior and the St. Mary's River came from the Institute for Fisheries Research (IFR) version 1 (v1) of the 10-minute grids. 2) 10-minute grids for Lake Erie came from version 2 of the IFR 10-minute grids created by the Great Lakes GIS (GLGIS) project, and 3) 5-minute grids for SCDRS came from 5-minute grids developed by the GLGIS project.Version 1 of the IFR 10-minute grids were created in 1998, and only covered Lakes Huron, Michigan, and Superior, and the St. Mary's River. This is the GIS dataset that was used as the grid standard for the 2000 consent decree. The grid boundaries and ID values in v1 were based off of the paper maps depicted in the 1989 Status of the Fisheries Resource Report (Technical Review Committee, 1989) with some very minor grid boundary differences likely caused by bringing the paper map into a digital GIS format. In v1, 10-minute grids do not always have rectangular boundaries where each side represents 10-minutes of latitude and longitude, especially near the shoreline. In order to create the v3.2 composite layer, some features in the v1 GIS dataset that were missing ID values were assigned ID values based on historical creel maps or nearby grid ID values.Version 2 of the IFR 10-minute grids was created in 2006 and provides coverage forall five Great Lakes, but only partial coverage in the connecting channels, with no coverage in SCDRS. In contrast to v1, 10-minute grids in this dataset are true 10-minute grids with rectangular sides that strictly follow 10-minute latitude and longitude lines (along with some cases where two true 10-minute grids were combined into one grid cell with one ID value). Due to the differences in grid boundaries, there are some different ID values across v1 and v2.The GLGIS 5-minute grid GIS dataset was created in 2006 at IFR. This layer contains rectangular 5-minute grids that are true 5-minute grids, with each side of every grid representing 5-minutes of latitude or longitude. 5-minute grids were used for SCDRS in v3.2 to align with historical data reporting standards in the region, and because there are no 10-minute grids that fully cover SCDRS. 5-minute grids created by the GLGIS only exist for SCDRS, Lake Erie, and Lake Huron, and the reason for this is unknown.SCDRS grids on the Canadian side of the basin are included in v3.2 for Fisheries Division data reporting needs that may include Canadian areas of SCDRS, but these grids in Canadian waters may not represent the standard that is actively used by Canadian agencies.In order to create the v3.2 composite, grid cells from the various GIS data sources were merged together for water bodies as specified above. In v3.2 the grids are almost exactly as they appear in the source data (with minor edits such as edge matching) except where 10-minute grids 602 and 603 in Lake Erie from Version 2 were replaced with GLGIS 5-minute grids. These grids cover the transition between the Detroit River and Lake Erie, where 10-minute grids are too large for some fisheries data reporting purposes. Therefore in v3.2, the two 10-minute grids were replaced with four 5-minute grids from the GLGIS 5-minute grid dataset. ID values were kept from the 5-minute grids for the two northern cells but the two southern grids cells retain ID values from the GLGIS v2 10-minute grids (602 and 603). This was done to allow continuity with historical data that has been recorded for 10-minute grids 602 and 603, but users need to be aware that these ID values in v3.2 are now associated with 5-minute grids instead of 10-minute grids.Version 3.2 was subsequently slightly altered to create Version 3.3, which replaced the shoreline in Northern Lake Huron and slightly altered the shoreline near the Soo Locks in the St. Mary's River to match zones, closures, etc. described in the Consent Decree that were depicted with a more detailed shoreline than the v3.2 shoreline. This was done so that those zones, closures, etc. could be depicted along with the Michigan Great Lakes Grids and have alligning shoerline depictions (see Figures 13, 12 & 16 for examples of the more detailed shoreline).GIS layer was last updated 10/01/2019.Metadata last updated 10/02/2019.",eng,Michigan Department of Natural Resources,"","",Michigan DNR Open Data Portal,Datasets|Web services,Vector data,"","",MichiganDepartmentofNaturalResources(MDNR)|GreatLakes|Grids|InstituteforFisheriesResearch(IFR)|5-minute|10-minute,Continually updated resource,2019-07-10,"",Michigan,"-168.24,69.85,170.78,76.1","POLYGON((-168.24 76.1, 170.78 76.1, 170.78 69.85, -168.24 69.85, -168.24 76.1))","","",ba5cc745-21c5-4ae9-954b-72dd8db6815a,06a-02,"","","","",Shapefile,,,false,,https://gis-midnr.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/midnr::michigan-great-lakes-grids-2.zip,https://services3.arcgis.com/Jdnp1TjADvSDxMAX/arcgis/rest/services/dnrFisheries/FeatureServer/7,,,,,,https://gis-midnr.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/midnr::michigan-great-lakes-grids-2,,,,,,,,,,,,6c70d3b0b8b544a0b22c919aa649458a_7,https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/6c70d3b0b8b544a0b22c919aa649458a,06a-02,"Note that organizations may be using slightly different versions of grid datasets across the basin, so exercise caution when exchanging grid data summaries.

St. Louis River Area of Concern (AOC): Minnesota,St. Louis River Area of Concern (AOC),"In an effort to clean up the most polluted areas in the Great Lakes, the United States and Canada committed to working with State and Provincial governments to develop Remedial Action Plans for designated Areas of Concern (AOC) in the Great Lakes Basin. Currently there are 26 AOCs wholly within the United States and five that are shared by both the United States and Canada. This shapefile provides a polygon boundary for the St. Louis River Area of Concern and the Expanded Study Area surrounding Duluth, Minnesota, and Superior, Wisconsin. In developing the polygon boundary, the description of each AOC provided by EPA was used as a starting point for collecting basemap information to aid in the delineation of each boundary. Using Digital Orthophotography, Digital Raster Graphics, and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) layers such as watersheds, and water bodies where available, each polygon was then digitized and reviewed by representatives of both EPA, the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources for agreement. Sources of digital information used in the development of the AOCs include the USGS, the Microsoft Corporation Terraserver ( http://terraserver.homeadvisor.msn.com/default.aspx ), the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources GIS Data Deli ( http://deli.dnr.state.mn.us/ ), and the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources ( http://www.dnr.state.wi.us/ ).",eng,U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Great Lakes National Program Office,null,"",Minnesota Geospatial Commons,Datasets,Vector data,National government records,Boundaries,great lakes|2022-creator-sprint,2020,2016-06-29,2020-2020,Minnesota,"-93.208,46.317,-91.456,47.785","POLYGON((-93.208 47.785, -91.456 47.785, -91.456 46.317, -93.208 46.317, -93.208 47.785))",http://sws.geonames.org/5037779,"",ba5cc745-21c5-4ae9-954b-72dd8db6815a,05a-01,"","","","",Shapefile,,,false,,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_dnr/bdry_st_louis_river_aoc/shp_bdry_st_louis_river_aoc.zip,,,,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_dnr/bdry_st_louis_river_aoc/metadata/metadata.html,,,https://gisdata.mn.gov/dataset/bdry-st-louis-river-aoc,,,,,,,,,,,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_dnr/bdry_st_louis_river_aoc/metadata/preview.jpg,13203252-7f0c-42dc-bfa6-82feb06e2b9d,https://gisdata.mn.gov/dataset/bdry-st-louis-river-aoc,05a-01,"","","",Public,CKAN,,2020-08-31,,Active,published,false,false,"",,2021-04-26 17:03:14 UTC,2023-02-03 22:27:31 UTC

St. Louis River Area of Concern Sediment Assessment Areas: Minnesota,St. Louis River Area of Concern Sediment Assessment Areas,"The St. Louis River is the second-largest tributary to Lake Superior. The lower estuary culminates in the Duluth-Superior Harbor, which is the largest freshwater seaport in North America. In 1987, concerns over environmental quality conditions prompted the designation of the lower St. Louis River as one of 43 Great Lakes Areas of Concern (AOCs). This includes the segment from Cloquet, Minn., to Lake Superior.Due to sediment contamination, the St. Louis River AOC has several impaired uses, including degradation of bottom-feeding invertebrate communities, increased incidence of fish tumors and other abnormalities, fish consumption advisories, and restrictions on dredging. Some sediment-derived contaminants also appear to be carried by the water column to Lake Superior, the most pristine Great Lake.The work products developed were:-Sediment Assessment Area chemistry characterization (dashboards) -Maps of sediment contaminants for multiple depth intervals-Database queries to assist in conducting independent analysis of the sediment contaminant levels in the AOC-Memorandum describing a systematic approach for assigning contaminant-level categories to each assessment areaThe polygons included in this data product depict boundaries of the St. Louis River Area of Concern sediment assessment areas [SAAs].",eng,Minnesota Pollution Control Agency,fst00531926,"",Minnesota Geospatial Commons,Datasets,Vector data,State government records,Environment,geographic zones|sediment assessment areas|slr aoc|st louis river|st louis river area of concern|2022-creator-sprint,2020,2020-04-15,2020-2020,Minnesota,"-92.495,46.637,-91.868,46.903","POLYGON((-92.495 46.903, -91.868 46.903, -91.868 46.637, -92.495 46.637, -92.495 46.903))",http://sws.geonames.org/5037779,"",ba5cc745-21c5-4ae9-954b-72dd8db6815a,05a-01,"","","","",Shapefile,,,false,,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_pca/env_sed_assessment_areas/shp_env_sed_assessment_areas.zip,,,,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_pca/env_sed_assessment_areas/metadata/metadata.html,,,https://gisdata.mn.gov/dataset/env-sed-assessment-areas,,,,,,,,,,,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_pca/env_sed_assessment_areas/preview/preview.jpg,1c4a687e-6ec9-4dfa-87d9-7075b5acc55f,https://gisdata.mn.gov/dataset/env-sed-assessment-areas,05a-01,"","","",Public,CKAN,,2020-08-31,,Active,published,false,false,"",,2021-04-26 17:03:14 UTC,2023-02-03 22:27:31 UTC

DNR NextGeneration Hydrography - DNR Watercourses derived from LiDAR: Minnesota,DNR NextGeneration Hydrography - DNR Watercourses derived from LiDAR,"This dataset contains linear features representing watercourse segments generated from a LiDAR-derived DEM (Digital Elevation Model). Features are defined from confluence-to-confluence and have accurate flow direction. Watercourse IDs (DNR Kittle Numbers) are currently being added so that measured watercourse routes can be generated. Data is currently available for DNR Major Watersheds #1 - Lake Superior North (HUC8 04010101 Baptism-Brule) and #2 Lake Superior - South (HUC8 04010102 Beaver-Lester) only.Recent efforts by the DNR Geospatial Water Resources Team (gWRT) http://www.dnr.state.mn.us/watersheds/wrt.html have focused on the development of methodology to derive new hydrography (i.e., watercourses, watershed boundaries) from LiDAR data sources. The increased level of detail, accuracy and currentness of the LiDAR elevation data produces features that much better reflect the current hydrography of Minnesota's landscape. This is the first vector product generated from LiDAR for inclusion into MNDNR's NextGeneration Hydrography dataset. SCALEThe Category 1 features in this dataset correspond, approximately, to DNR 24K (1:24,000) scale hydrography features and generally represent perennial and intermittent streams and ditches (although stream types haven't been determined for LiDAR-derived watercourses). A flow accumulation threshold value >= 10,000 m was used to extract these linear features from a hydrologically-modified LiDAR-derived 1m DEM (hDEM). This is equivalent to a drainage area of ~ 2.47 acres. Additional water conveyance features and flow paths were derived which meet smaller flow accumulation threshold values, although these categories are not yet complete. See contact Person Information (below) for information about these additional features.CARTOGRAPHIC REPRESENTATIONThe data is presented in both original (unsmoothed) and smoothed versions. The smoothing process used was ArcToolbox: Cartography: Generalization: Smooth Line (PAEK method, 5m tolerance). This tool removes sharp angles in linear features (from the raster to vector conversion process) to improve cartographic quality. Users should note that the smoothing process can potentially move or reshape a watercourse feature in such a way that it no longer matches the original LiDAR source. A small tolerance limit (5m) was used here to minimize such errors. Results indicate that the smoothing process reduced feature lengths across the two major watersheds by a mean percentage of - 6.51% (loss). To retain true watercourse lengths for calculations, etc., the [LENGTH_MI] attribute gives the length of the original UNSMOOTHED linear feature. The [SMOOTHED_MI] attribute gives the length of the smoothed feature, while the [PERCENT_CHNG] field provides the percentage change (loss) in length due to the smoothing process.FUNDINGThis project was funded in part by the Coastal Management Act of 1972, as amended, by NOAA's Office for Coastal Management in cooperation with the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources - Minnesota's Lake Superior Coastal Program.These environmental data and related items of information have not been formally disseminated by NOAA and do not represent and should not be construed to represent any agency determination, view, or policy.This project was funded in part by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency through the Clean Water Fund from the Clean Water, Land and Legacy Amendment.This project was coordinated to support the 2015 Lake Superior Lakewide Action and Management Plan (LAMP) goals under High Quality Habitats, ""Integrate spatial data standards and methodologies to identify and prioritize sites for habitat protection and rehabilitation and develop targeted geomatics products for lakewide action and management.""Moving Forward (2017): The gWRT is currently seeking funding to continue generation of LiDAR-derived hydrography across the state.",eng,Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) - Division of Fish & Wildlife - Fisheries Unit,null,"",Minnesota Geospatial Commons,Datasets,Vector data|Vector data|LiDAR,State government records,Inland waters,hydrography|rivers|streams|water|watercourses|2022-creator-sprint,2020,2019-03-14,2020-2020,Minnesota,"-97.23,43.5,-89.53,49.37","POLYGON((-97.23 49.37, -89.53 49.37, -89.53 43.5, -97.23 43.5, -97.23 49.37))",http://sws.geonames.org/5037779,"",ba5cc745-21c5-4ae9-954b-72dd8db6815a,05a-01,"","","","",Shapefile,,,false,,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_dnr/water_dnr_hydrography_from_lidar/shp_water_dnr_hydrography_from_lidar.zip,,,,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_dnr/water_dnr_hydrography_from_lidar/metadata/metadata.html,,,https://gisdata.mn.gov/dataset/water-dnr-hydrography-from-lidar,,,,,,,,,,,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_dnr/water_dnr_hydrography_from_lidar/metadata/preview.jpg,c683565b-f104-4e08-864c-b4a9d01af0fc,https://gisdata.mn.gov/dataset/water-dnr-hydrography-from-lidar,05a-01,"","","",Public,CKAN,,2020-08-31,,Active,published,false,false,"",,2021-04-26 17:02:59 UTC,2023-02-03 22:27:27 UTC

Seed Source Control Seed Zones of Minnesota: Minnesota,Seed Source Control Seed Zones of Minnesota,"Seed source control is the operational process of returning reproductive materials - seeds, seedlings, cuttings, or transplants - to an environment that closely resembles the ones they originated from. Seed source control prevents losses by avoiding the use of non-adapted materials in artificial regeneration. Seed source control establishes collection and deployment zones based on climate homogeneity. Based on climatic data, six seed zones were determined appropriate and adequate for Minnesota. An area of special concern is the north shore area of Lake Superior. This area lies roughly from Two Harbors to the Canadian border and, from the shoreline to the ridge that defines the north shore. Several studies have shown this region to consistently produce trees with slower growth. Unless there is some compelling local need, seed should not be collected from this area.",eng,Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR),null,"",Minnesota Geospatial Commons,Datasets,Vector data,State government records,Boundaries,seed source control|seed zones|2022-creator-sprint,2020,2015-11-03,2020-2020,Minnesota,"-97.23,43.5,-89.53,49.37","POLYGON((-97.23 49.37, -89.53 49.37, -89.53 43.5, -97.23 43.5, -97.23 49.37))",http://sws.geonames.org/5037779,"",ba5cc745-21c5-4ae9-954b-72dd8db6815a,05a-01,"","","","",Shapefile,,,false,,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_dnr/bdry_seed_source_control_zones/shp_bdry_seed_source_control_zones.zip,,,,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_dnr/bdry_seed_source_control_zones/metadata/metadata.html,,,https://gisdata.mn.gov/dataset/bdry-seed-source-control-zones,,,,,,,,,,,https://resources.gisdata.mn.gov/pub/gdrs/data/pub/us_mn_state_dnr/bdry_seed_source_control_zones/metadata/preview.jpg,97bc6a72-45e6-4f68-9318-99f7c36f691b,https://gisdata.mn.gov/dataset/bdry-seed-source-control-zones,05a-01,"","","",Public,CKAN,,2020-08-31,,Active,published,false,false,"",,2021-04-26 17:03:13 UTC,2023-02-03 22:27:31 UTC

The Shoreline Inventory in the Great Lakes Coastal Oblique Photo Viewer are part of Dave Mickelson's research. The shoreline features in this file represent qaulitative 1976 backshore (bluff or low bank) conditions on Lake Michigan from Sturgeon Bay Canal south to the Illinois state line. Beach condition classifications used in the mapping were tested and modified several times before final mapping was begun.Initial results were reported to the Wisconsin Coastal Management's Coastal Hazards Committee, and their feedback and the initial testing led to the following beach and bluff classifications. All of the shoreline for each date (1976 and 2007) had three components of classification: beach description, backshore description, and structure type.Shore parallel structures that are onshore were mapped under beach description because they had length along the shoreline being segmented. Groins, jetties, and offshore breakwaters were mapped under structure type as points because most had no significant longshore dimension, or in the case of offshore breakwaters, no line to map on. Some were mapped as points and also as having extent along the shore.In 1976 black-and-white oblique air photos were taken by Wisconsin DNR as part of a major shoreline erosion project. They covered the Lake Michigan shoreline from Sturgeon Bay Canal south to the Illinois state line. They also covered the Wisconsin part of Lake Superior shoreline.In spring 2007 oblique digital photos were taken along the Lake Michigan shoreline from Sturgeon Bay Canal to the Illinois state line.

Some were mapped as points and also as having extent along the shore.In 1976 black-and-white oblique air photos were taken by Wisconsin DNR as part of a major shoreline erosion project. They covered the Lake Michigan shoreline from Sturgeon Bay Canal south to the Illinois state line. They also covered the Wisconsin part of Lake Superior shoreline.In spring 2007 oblique digital photos were taken along the Lake Michigan shoreline from Sturgeon Bay Canal to the Illinois state line. Conditions along the shoreline were mapped in a GIS by David Mickelson between September, 2008 and February, 2009 using the 1976 and 2007 photos.The 1976 photographs were geo-located by identifying features that could be seen in the oblique views and Microsoft Virtual Earth and if necessary the 2007 oblique photos.

Carnegie-05-Pitt; Carnegie- 5; Pittsburgh,Carnegie-05-Pitt,"Statement of responsibility: [Works Progress Administration of Pennsylvania]. Relief on most maps shown by contours and spot heights. WPA Project Numbers: 4483 -- 19666 -- 25734 -- No. 65-23-5001 -- No. 465-23-3-192. Each sheet is named and may have a letter code of A, B, C, or D following the name, corresponding to specific government contracts. These letter codes indicate a particular contract as follows:  A =  Contract No. 4483; B = Contract No. 65-23-5001 + No. 465-23-3-192; C = Contract No. 19666; and D = Contract No. 25734. Contract 19666 was used for mapping the oil and gas wells involved. Maps cover the time period of 1934-1936, project was intended to continue through 1938. There are ca. 1159 possible sheets. The set includes some base maps without any mine information on them. Some maps, including some base maps,  show oil and gas wells and whether they are active or abandoned, in addition to coal seams. Some coal seams are mis-identified, some mines are omitted, and some mine locations are mis-mapped. Some sheets include handprinted notes indicating the source of contours used, whether from actual survey or from an existing base map, for that particular sheet. Sheet numbering is based on a system of subdividing a 15-minute quadrangle base map into 9 equivalent 2.5-minute segments; in some cases not all nine segments were used as part of the mapping done for the project. Sponsored by the Pennsylvania Bureau of Mines. Includes multiple sheets of some quadrangles to display different coal seams and/or oil and gas wells within the same region. Shaded, dotted areas represent retreat mined areas. Specific coal seams are abbreviated as follows: Brookville = Brk. -- Clarion = Clar. -- Lower Bakerstown = LB -- Lower Freeport = LF -- Lower Kittanning = LK -- Middle Kittanning = MK -- Pittsburgh = Pitt. -- Sewickley = Sew. -- Upper Freeport = UF -- Upper Kittanning = UK -- Washington = Wash. -- Waynesburg = Wayn. -- Redstone = Red. Some maps include structural contours. Some sheets/seams were mapped multiple times within the project but at different dates and/or under different projects.Add&#x27;l physical form: Some sheets also issued on mylar. Geographic coverage includes the following counties: Allegheny, Armstrong, Beaver, Bedford, Blair, Bradford, Butler, Cambria, Cameron, Centre, Clarion, Clearfield, Clinton, Elk, Fayette, Forest, Fulton, Greene, Huntingdon, Indiana, Jefferson, Lawrence, Lycoming, Mercer, Somerset, Sullivan, Tioga, Venango, Washington, Westmoreland.
