"Dabao Kinbōzu, Maps Index","","This polygon GeoJSON file is an index to 1:50000 scale maps of Davao (Philippines), titled 'Dabao Kinbōzu -- ダバオ近傍圖/Dabao Kinbōzu.’ This map series was originally produced by the Japanese Land Survey Department of the General Staff Headquarters in 1944. Stanford University Libraries holds a large collection of Japanese military and imperial maps, referred to as gaihōzu, or ""maps of outer lands."" These maps were produced starting in the early Meiji (1868-1912) era and the end of World War II by the Land Survey Department of the General Staff Headquarters, the former Japanese Army. The Library is in the process of scanning and making available all of the maps in the collection. To create this index, footprints were generated using the fishnet tool, and metadata were supplied for the digitized paper maps by Stanford University Libraries. After the footprints were created, the GeoJSON was trimmed and labeled according to the sources.This layer provides an index map that can be used to locate individual scanned map sheets.","","","",Stanford Geospatial Center,"","",Stanford,Datasets,Vector data|Polygon data,"",Boundaries,"",1944,2016,"","",Davao (Philippines),"POLYGON((125  7.3333,  126  7.3333,  126  6.6666, 125  6.6666, 125  7.3333))","125, 6.6666, 126, 7.3333","6.99995,125.5",,"","","","","","","","","","","",Public,GeoJSON,,,,stanford-fb897vt9938,http://purl.stanford.edu/fb897vt9938,,,,"",,Active,published,true,,"",,2021-04-27 18:50:18 UTC,2024-05-01 15:42:37 UTC,,https://gist.githubusercontent.com/mejackreed/4a44f1f7cc4fbb926068738e903a9e96/raw/fedfb0e599d647920f084627b7dca8f88a358757/stanford-fb897vt9938.geojson,,,,,,,http://purl.stanford.edu/fb897vt9938,,,,http://purl.stanford.edu/fb897vt9938.mods,,https://gist.githubusercontent.com/mejackreed/4a44f1f7cc4fbb926068738e903a9e96/raw/fedfb0e599d647920f084627b7dca8f88a358757/stanford-fb897vt9938.geojson,,,,,,,,,,

Louisiana voting districts from 2010 Census,"","Voting districts in Louisiana based on the US decennial Census of 2010. The TIGER/Line shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. Voting district is the generic name for geographic entities such as precincts, wards, and election districts established by State governments for the purpose of conducting elections. States participating in the 2010 Census Redistricting Data Program as part of Public Law 94-171 (1975) provided the Census Bureau with boundaries, codes, and names for their VTDs. Each VTD is identified by a 1- to 6-character alphanumeric census code that is unique within county. For the 2010 Census, Rhode Island is the only State that did not participate in Phase 2 (the Voting District Project) of the Redistricting Data Program and no VTDs exist for this State in the 2010 Census data products. Note that only Montana and Oregon do not have complete coverage of VTDs for the 2010 Census.","","","","US Census Bureau, Geography Division","","",Princeton,Datasets,Polygon data,Census|voting districts|electoral districts|electoral boundaries|state legislative district|Boundaries,"","",2010|2012|2012,2012,"","",Louisiana,"ENVELOPE(-94.043352, -88.758388, 33.019543, 28.855127)","-94.043352, 28.855127, -88.758388, 33.019543","30.937334999999997,-91.40087",,"","","","","","","","","","","",Public,Shapefile,,,https://figgy.princeton.edu/downloads/a287cc33-3c2b-4cca-bdd2-525bc18ece49/file/6b6a9b1e-50a9-47bd-8395-0bd697e1f9c5,princeton-t722hd30j,ark:/88435/t722hd30j,,,,"",,,published,,,"",,2024-04-17 21:23:05 UTC,2024-05-01 15:42:37 UTC,,https://figgy.princeton.edu/downloads/a287cc33-3c2b-4cca-bdd2-525bc18ece49/file/7f5a693a-617e-4fe8-88ce-5f3b2c24a017,,https://figgy.princeton.edu/downloads/75bc7983-c0fa-4d54-8422-490bc63185dc/file/0c4e793f-d149-44e1-8d46-59e695441420,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://geodata.lib.princeton.edu/fe/d2/80/fed28076eaa04506b7956f10f61a2f77/display_vector.pmtiles,,,,
