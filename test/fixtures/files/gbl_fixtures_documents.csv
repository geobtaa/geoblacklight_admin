The survey for Elkhorn Slough was conducted 8/12/2005 - 8/15/2005. Elkhorn Slough, one of the largest remaining coastal wetlands in California, has been directly subjected to tidal scour since the opening of Moss Landing Harbor in 1946. This erosion endangers the habitat of several rare and endangered species and disrupts the wetland ecosystem as a whole. In 2003, the Seafloor Mapping Lab of California State University, Monterey Bay created the most detailed bathymetry model of the Slough to date using a combination of multi-beam sonar, single-beam sonar and aerial photography. This layer was created as part of the California Seafloor Mapping Project.This project was conducted to determine changes in the pattern of erosion and deposition in Elkhorn Slough since surveys conducted in 1993, 2001 and 2003. Marine data offered here represent the efforts of a comprehensive state waters mapping program for California launched by the California State Coastal Conservancy, Ocean Protection Council, Department of Fish and Game, and the NOAA National Marine Sanctuary Program. The ultimate goal is the creation of a high-resolution 1:24,000 scale geologic and habitat base map series covering all of California's 14,500 km2 state waters out to the 3 mile limit, and support of the state's Marine Life Protection Act Initiative (MLPA) goal to create a statewide network of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs). This statewide project requires, involves and leverages expertise from industry, resource management agencies and academia. The tiered mapping campaign involves the use of state-of-the-art sonar, LIDAR (aerial laser) and video seafloor mapping technologies; computer aided classification and visualization; expert geologic and habitat interpretations codified into strip maps spanning California's land/sea boundary; and the creation of an online, publicly accessible data repository for the dissemination of all mapping products.\n",eng,"","",Seafloor Mapping Lab,"",Seafloor Mapping Lab,Stanford,Datasets,Raster data,GBL Fixtures|Continental margins|Multibeam mapping,Imagery|Elevation|Inland Waters,GBL Fixture records,2005,1905-06-27,2005,2005-2005,Elkhorn Slough (Calif.)|Monterey Bay (Calif.),"ENVELOPE(-121.7948738,-121.7389503,36.8606925,36.8085911)","-121.7948738,36.8085911,-121.7389503,36.8606925","36.8346418,-121.76691205",,"","","","","","","","","","These data are licensed by Stanford Libraries and are available to Stanford University affiliates only.

2015 New York City Subway Complexes and Ridership,baruch_documentation_download,"Point dataset with WMS and WFS, documentation download, and two parent records. |The subway complexes layer was created to represent ridership data for the NYC subway system (Metropolitan Transportation Authority, or MTA). This layer is a subset of the subway stations layer (nyu_2451_34503) that has been combined with MTA statistics on ridership; it was originally created in August 2012 and has been updated annually. Ridership data is not available for each individual subway station, as many stations are linked via common entrances and passageways where transfers are free, and because ridership data is not collected for the Staten Island Railway stations. This layer was created by choosing an individual station from nyu_2451_34503 to represent the entire complex, and modifying the station name and train fields appropriately. It should be used for mapping ridership data or for analysis that requires this data, and not for specifying actual station locations or measuring distances. There are 421 complexes, and the field station_ct indicates how many stations are part of a complex. Annual, average weekday, and average weekend ridership is provided for 2007 to 2014. The unique ID is complex_id, which was created by alphabetizing the complexes by borough and station name and assigning a sequential number to a borough prefix. This layer does not include the new 34th St - 11 Av station on the 7 line; it will be updated in summer 2016 once ridership data becomes available.

Louisiana voting districts from 2010 Census,"","Voting districts in Louisiana based on the US decennial Census of 2010. The TIGER/Line shapefiles and related database files (.dbf) are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic information from the U.S. Census Bureau's Master Address File / Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (MAF/TIGER) Database (MTDB). The MTDB represents a seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts, however, each TIGER/Line shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set, or they can be combined to cover the entire nation. Voting district is the generic name for geographic entities such as precincts, wards, and election districts established by State governments for the purpose of conducting elections. States participating in the 2010 Census Redistricting Data Program as part of Public Law 94-171 (1975) provided the Census Bureau with boundaries, codes, and names for their VTDs. Each VTD is identified by a 1- to 6-character alphanumeric census code that is unique within county. For the 2010 Census, Rhode Island is the only State that did not participate in Phase 2 (the Voting District Project) of the Redistricting Data Program and no VTDs exist for this State in the 2010 Census data products. Note that only Montana and Oregon do not have complete coverage of VTDs for the 2010 Census.","","","","US Census Bureau, Geography Division","","",Princeton,Datasets,Polygon data,GBL Fixtures|Census|voting districts|electoral districts|electoral boundaries|state legislative district|Boundaries,"","",2010|2012|2012,2012,"","",Louisiana,"ENVELOPE(-94.043352, -88.758388, 33.019543, 28.855127)","-94.043352, 28.855127, -88.758388, 33.019543","30.937334999999997,-91.40087",,"","","","","","","","","","","","",Public,Shapefile,,,https://figgy.princeton.edu/downloads/a287cc33-3c2b-4cca-bdd2-525bc18ece49/file/6b6a9b1e-50a9-47bd-8395-0bd697e1f9c5,princeton-t722hd30j,ark:/88435/t722hd30j,,,,"",,,published,,,"",,2024-04-17 16:23:05 -0500,2024-11-06 17:08:36 -0600,"",,,"","",""
